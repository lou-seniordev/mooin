## 📌 Introduction

Moni Moni is fundamentally a crowdfunded small-scale loaning service. Users can post their loan requests along with the interest they can payback and the reason they want money for, other users can view the request and decide whether they want to invest in the person depending upon the interest rate and the reason for request.
