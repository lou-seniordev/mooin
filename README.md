## 📌 Introduction

Moni Moni is fundamentally a crowdfunded small-scale loaning service. Users can post their loan requests along with the interest they can payback and the reason they want money for, other users can view the request and decide whether they want to invest in the person depending upon the interest rate and the reason for request.

## 📝 Further Changes to be Done

There are a lot of loopholes legal and logical, our first and topmost priority is to work upon them. We are well aware of the potential for scam and a workaround is needed. We also wish to plan on integrating Blockchain transactions in the future.
